I found this article interesting because it gives insight into the life of developers at big tech. Given the reputation of these companies, one might expect developers at these companies to be busy doing innovative work that only extremely skilled programmers could accomplish. However, in the case of Devon, his workload is so little that he works only one hour daily, and this seems to be working just fine for him as he still has his job. It begs the question of how much work are big tech software engineers really doing.

-Chelsea Li: I thought it was really interesting how Devon was able to complete all of his work in less than half of a workday and still make 150k salary while pursuing other dreams!
